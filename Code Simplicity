The whole idea of Code Simplicity:

Software design now is indispensable in all engineering fields, research and development to say the least. You are not complete unless you develop this important competency.

To borrow a page from Google policies in software design:

The Equation of Software Design:

D = (Vn x Vf ) / (Ei x Em)
where:
D  Stands for the desirability of the change.
Vn  Stands for value now.
Vf  Stands for future value.
Ei  Stands for the effort of implementation.
Em  Stands for the effort of maintenance.

As time goes on, this equation reduces to:
D = (Vf ) / (Em)
Which demonstrates that it is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.

The laws of Software design:

1. The purpose of software is to help people.
2. The Law of Change: The longer your program exists, the more probable it is that any piece of it will have to change.
3. The Law of Defect Probability: The chance of introducing a defect into your program is proportional to the size of the changes you make to it.
4. The Law of Simplicity: The ease of maintenance of any piece of software is proportional to the simplicity of its individual pieces.
5. The Law of Testing: The degree to which you know how your software behaves is the degree to which you have accurately tested it.

If you wanted to sum up the most important facts to keep in mind about software design in two simple sentences, they would be:
• It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.
• The effort of maintenance is proportional to the complexity of the system.
